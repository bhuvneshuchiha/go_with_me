# Tasks related to terminal_helper. Improvement points and somethings for v2

1-  Add the logic to see if the file exists at the path and then delete it. - Done
2-  Make all operations using absolute path to keep it generic - Done

    main.go is.
4-  Add the some UI using bubble tea.
5-  Give some styling using Lip Gloss.
6-  This project should be done end to end no matter what.

9-  Add a way to add tmux themes -- V2
10- You can write code to install tmux theme, create a new .tmux file, copy
    contents from old one. -- V2
11- Once copied, add the new installation lines in that theme and delete the
    older .tmux files. -- V2
12- Add something to write things onto zshell script as well if something
    requires that. -- V2

# Update as of 7th August->
1-  Issue encountered in tmux session creation.Using pky package I was able to
    create a tmux session but when it gets created it starts with some garbage
    value plus the tmux has no cursor but still we can write there, not very
    UI appealing. -- Will be fixed in V2

# Planning for 7th 8th August->
1-  Stop with tmux and wrap whatever is made to bubble tea and use lip gloss for
    UI -- V2

# SUMMARY

*   Basic setup is complete, the points mentioned in V2 will be covered in a
    few weeks when I get time and more practice of GOLANG

    Moreover, I will also wrap this whole project in Bubble Tea and Lip Gloss.
